# Yelp
This is a Yelp Search app that uses the Yelp Search API.

User Stories
The following user stories must be completed:

Search results page
[+] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
[+] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
[+] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
    Hint: This is just a UISearchBar that is set as the navigationItem.titleView
[+] Optional: Infinite scroll for restaurant results
[ ] Optional: Implement map view of restaurant results

Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters in the real Yelp App, are supported in the Yelp API.
[+] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
[+] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
[+] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. 
[ ] Optional: implement a custom switch
[+] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
[ ] Optional: Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app.
[ ] Optional: Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand.
[ ] A formatted list of categories available in the Public API can be found here.
[ ] Optional: Implement the restaurant detail page.
